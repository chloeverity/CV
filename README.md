## Chloe Verity

Junior Developer

Recent graduate in modern languages, now learning software prose.

I'm a recent departee of the influencer marketing industry; upon exiting, my one and only thought was how the best part of my job was teaching myself how to code newsletters. I thus began upon my path to become a software developer, opting to attend Makers Academy, where I can't wait to use my logic and analytic skills to build things and solve problems.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have always been adept with words, so it came as no shock when, upon asking for more responsibility at my previous company, I was promoted to the role of Client and Community relations manager. This included liaising with clients on an accounts management basis, database management, creation of sales materials and proposals, drafting templates for all communications on a company wide level, as well as writing copy for, and designing all newsletters and app notifications that went out to different clients and candidates (over 20 a week, to thousands of individuals, maintaining a 60% open rate and a 10% click rate - the industry average is 10% and 1% respectively).

The latter entailed teaching myself how to code from scratch, so that I could build templates and ensure the process became more efficient, as well as ensuring my attention to detail, encouraging my curiosity (which I satisfied through A/B testing), as well as my engaging my organisational tendencies.

#### Analytics

My affinity towards mathematic and logic are what I have to thank for my practice in analytics; it allowed me to pioneer data dives (including psychographic data) at my last job. My analysis presentations, along with conclusions and suggested next steps were shown at client meetings at WPP ltd., advice which they followed with subsequent campaigns for high up clients such as Godiva Chocolates, and Wilkinson Sword.

I then decided to insist it as a mandatory part of our process to include pre, mid, and post campaign analytics, which would not only be shown to clients, but also used internally to streamline our process, making the experience for both candidates and clients as positive as possible.

However, an analytical mind is useless if you do not use the given data and conclusions to fix or improve the product, which brings me to my next point.

#### Innovation

In my previous role, we would have a weekly meeting to detail what we would like to see innovation-wise at the company over the next quarter. I challenged myself to come up with a handful of ideas for each meeting, several of which became reality over the course of my time there.

I have already described just a few of the projects I worked on to make sure the experience for our clients and candidates was a "6 star" one, but one of the achievements I am certainly most proud of was helming our ambassador program. This involved running trials, persuading people to join, maintaining a database of thousands of people (all of whom I contacted), and paying our ambassadors per person they managed to sign up to our service. This involved a lot of out-of-hours work, painstaking attention to detail, and a huge amount of teamwork and strategy.
